### Project Description
This hackathon project aims to bridge the gap between food donors and people in need, to promote sustainability an reduce food waste across the city

### The Problem statement
- Restaurants, hotels, and college canteens discard **30–40%** of prepared food daily due to unpredictable demand.
- At the same time, students, daily-wage workers, and low-income families face rising food costs and limited access to nutritious meals.
- Existing food donation systems are often slow, location-specific, or charity-only , leaving a massive gap for **timely, market-driven redistribution**.

### The Solution
ShareBite is a **web platform** that enables:

- List leftover food from Restaurants & canteens
- Helps people access food in lesser cost   
- Outcome → food saved from waste, money saved for buyers, goodwill earned by businesses.
